### Present work.

1. Classification Model for 5 diabetic-retinopathy (DR) classes;
1.1. How to use Tensorboard to visualize a model.
2. Tensorflow Object Detection API (TFODAPI)
2.1. How to prepare a TFODAPI dataset out of raw images.


### How it was made and why.

The whole project is made on Deep Learning using Tensorflow (1.12.0) because it is a great way to deal with image processing without the need to understand deeply how image processing actually works. 

The main problems that were encountered were on preparing the dataset for training, because usually each deep learning API requires a different format of input, such as TFRecord file, on Tensorflow Object Detection API (add reference). One other common issue encountered was on fine tuning the model to get better accuracy.

So using Deep Learning really was a good to approach the problem without much previous knowledge on image processing.

### Where are the codes and information?
On my [github](https://github.com/Caduunb), inside the repository VUT Project.

### What is missing.

1. Understand why the classification model is stuck on the same accuracy it starts the training with.
2. Object Detection model.

# Classification Model

## Prepare dataset

The [create_dataset.py](https://github.com/Caduunb/VUT-Project/blob/master/Classification/create_dataset.py) script takes the path of images, then, as it goes through the folders, it labels and compresses all of them into a .npz file. There's a label dictionary named labelDict, so the user will not get lost on which number corresponds to which label.

*Ideally, the classes would be saved in the correct order, {0: NoDR, 1: MildDR, 2: ModerateDR, 3: SevereDR, 4: ProliferativeDR}, but the script doesn't go through the folders in alphabetical order, which made it difficult to me to make it go in the order I wanted it to.*

## Train your model

You have to change the [model script's](https://github.com/Caduunb/VUT-Project/blob/master/Classification/classification_model.py) path to the .npz file.

## Use Tensorboard to visualize 

If you used pip to tensorflow on your computer, you will already have TensorBoard installed.

# Tensorflow Object Detection API (TFODAPI)

## Prepare Dataset

There are other ways to make it. But, the way I learned:

### 1. Create a .yaml extension file. 

It is simply a plain text with .yaml at the end. On this file ([example](https://github.com/Caduunb/VUT-Project/blob/master/TFODAPI/tfodapi_dataset_test.yaml)), there should contain all information about the image bouding box:

* Label (e.g, 'ball')
* Coordinates (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)
* Absolute path for the image (/home/user/example/example.jpeg)

This file will be used as input for the script that creates the TFRecordfile.

**Easy way to create the .yaml**

There's a script named [create_yaml.py](https://github.com/Caduunb/VUT-Project/blob/master/TFODAPI/create_yaml.py) which takes the path of the images you want to label, prompts you a window for you to label them and then creates a .yaml file afterwards with all the bounding boxes information. All you have to change inside the file is the path to images, and the output .yaml file path.

*Please note that the up to day, the script only works with 1 label. So every bounding box will be related to 1 single class, e.g., macula. If you will use 2 or more different classes (e.g., macula and optic disc), the script will have to updated for that.*

### 2. Create .record extension file.

This file is needed as input for the Tensorflow Object Detection API. There's a [script](https://github.com/Caduunb/VUT-Project/blob/master/TFODAPI/create_tfRecordFile.py) that creates a .record file with the information provided by the .yaml file.

After creating the .record extension file, you're good to go to the training session. Remember to create both training.record and validation.record.

## Train your model

This is where I stopped.
